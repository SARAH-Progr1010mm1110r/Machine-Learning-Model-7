# Machine-Learning-Model-7
**Using PCA as a preprocessing tool for machine learning experiments, and compare results with and without PCA preprocessing**

### Requirements:
* Split the data
* Perform EDA 
* Plot Requirements:
   * A short explanation of why the plot is important as if you were explaining it to someone who has never seen the plot before and is unfamiliar with the data.
   * Legend
   * Axis Labels
   * Title
* Determine a baseline model
* Scale the data
* Create a Logistic Regression model
* Compare the results to the baseline
* Perform PCA
* Create a Scree Plot
* Use Principal Components for a Logistic Regression model
* Compare results to the baseline and previous Logistic Regression Model without PCA and provide an explanation of what the results mean and the point of PCA
